## 3.	Implementation Plan
### Environment Setup:
Python + Streamlit for interface OpenAI API for LLM interactions
### Optionally:
SQLite for storing wellness history
### Prompt Engine Modules:
add_health_log(prompt) suggest_wellness_activity(mood_input) motivate_user(current_mood, energy_level) Progressive Prompt Design:
### Simple:
“Remind me to drink water every 3 hours.” Intermediate:
“Suggest a wellness plan for a tired and anxious day.”
### Advanced:
“I had a terrible sleep and I’m low on energy. What self-care should I do without screens?”
## 4. Evaluation and Feedback Collection
### Prompt:
“How do users feel about their wellness assistant after a week?”
### Feedback Collection Prompts:
“How helpful were today’s suggestions?” “Did this make your day feel more manageable?”
### Feedback Summary:
#### Liked:
Non-judgmental tone, variety of suggestions
### Wanted:
Integration with smartwatch, sleep tracking
## 5. Prototype/System Outline
### Backend:
Python + OpenAI API prompt management
SQLite file for logging mood and activities
### Frontend:
Streamlit dashboard: Mood slider, activity log, suggested actions
Minimal CLI for quick check-ins
### Sample Interaction:
“Hey! I see you rated your mood a 5/10 today. Let’s do a 2-min breathing exercise and a short gratitude note. How about: What’s one thing you’re proud of today? ”
## 6. User Testing Results and Improvement Plan
### User Testing:
10 participants used the wellness assistant for 7 days
Most used features: quick breathing breaks, motivation check-ins
## Results:
75% reported “improved awareness of emotional state”
60% adopted at least one new wellness habit
## Next Steps:
Add mood tracking graph
Support for audio mindfulness sessions
Gamify healthy habit streaks

# Result: The Prompt is executed successfully
